"""Tests for ProjectBuilder class."""

# Note: ProjectBuilder contains mostly compilation and build methods
# that require a working Fortran compiler and build environment.
# Therefore, most tests are integration tests rather than unit tests.
# The integration tests are performed through the FortranTestRunner
# in test_fortran_test_runner.py and through the examples directory.
